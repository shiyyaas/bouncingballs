# Bouncing Balls 🟢🎈

A lightweight browser demo of bouncing balls using HTML5 Canvas and JavaScript. Created as a Mulearn Foundation task. This repo contains a simple physics-inspired animation of multiple balls bouncing and colliding inside a canvas.

## 🚀 Features

- Smooth canvas animation using requestAnimationFrame ✨
- Ball-ball and ball-wall collisions (basic physics) 🔁
- Adjustable number of balls and basic properties (size, color, velocity) 🎨

## 🧭 How to run

1. Clone the repository:

   git clone https://github.com/shiyyaas/bouncingballs.git

2. Open index.html in your browser (no build step required):

   - Double-click the index.html file, or
   - Serve the folder with a static server, e.g. `npx http-server` and open http://localhost:8080

## 🛠️ Project structure

- index.html — main page with canvas
- script.js / src/ — JavaScript source for the animation
- styles.css — styling for the page

(Your repository may have slightly different file names; open the project root to inspect files.)
